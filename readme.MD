### HOW TO RUN ###
To run this code successfully, change the "DATA_PATH" global variable at the top of the python file to the location the 
python file is stored (if stored in the same folder, it should not need to be changed). Additionally, there is an svm.pkl which contains the trained SVC model, which should 
SIGNIFICANTLY reduce runtime of the entire program if loaded properly.
This code should not need any additional libraries beyond what is standard to run it.

All Grid Searches have been commented out with results hardcoded to cut down on total runtime.
